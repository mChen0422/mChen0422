Overview: Switch the communication topology between sensors to make sure that target can be tracked accurately in the environment of communication interference.
The target is tracked by multiple heterogeneous sensors with Kalman information filtering and distributed multi-sensor tracking algorithm. In order to simulate the change in communication topology between sensors due to the environmental effects, different sensor communication topologies are switched at 50,60,70,80,90 s respectively.
