title: About
---

 I am a graduate Software Engineer with a background in collaborating with development teams on quantitative engineering projects and developing web and mobile applications. My background includes knowledge of web programming technologies, an understanding of relational database design and querying concepts, and working knowledge of software development cycles.  
    In my previous role as a Quantitative Software Engineer for Blockpulse Digital Asset Management, I led a team of three engineers in implementing a Triangle Arbitrage Strategy in Python, which resulted in a 10% return. I also collaborated with ten software engineers to create Python back-testing and real-time trading of quantitative strategies.  
    Aside from working for Blockpulse, I also contributed to several software projects. These included developing a Java-based online food ordering web application called “Order Now” with ReactJS frontend and served RESTful API. I also helped to create Newswipe, an Android app with features that included a hot news display, keyword-based news search, news saving, and lazy mode, enabling automatic scrolling. My other projects to date were building a responsive website and a GoLang-based software purchase web application.  
    I am looking for opportunities to apply my diverse background and skillset in an entry-level software engineering role for a growth-oriented progressive organization. I am pursuing a master of science in engineering and financial mathematics at John Hopkins University. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Financial Mathematics from BNU-HKBU University United International College and certifications in Java for Programmers and React for Front-end Developer Offered by Educative.
