title: About
---

As a graduate software engineer with a strong background in collaborating with development teams on software engineering projects and developing web and mobile applications, I am passionate about leveraging my expertise in quantitative software engineering, full-stack development, and data-driven applications to make a significant impact in my next role.

In my previous role as a Quantitative Software Developer at Blockpulse Digital Asset Management, I was involved in developing back-end services for an automated trading app, managing HTTP requests, and interacting with MySQL databases using MyBatis for data processing. To ensure code quality, I conducted functional unit testing with PowerMock, achieving 90% code coverage. Additionally, I worked in a team to back-test quantitative strategies using the Python BackTrader library, focusing on grid strategy, random forests-based strategy, and time series data modeling. My experience in cross-functional teams has allowed me to develop practical communication skills and adapt quickly to new challenges.

Outside of my work at Blockpulse, I have contributed to various software projects, including:

Order Now: A Java-based online food ordering web application with ReactJS frontend and served RESTful API.
Newswipe: An Android news app with features like a hot news display, keyword-based news search, news saving, and automatic scrolling.
urLibrary: A Python-based online library web application with Angular frontend, Flask backend, and MongoDB as the NoSQL database, featuring functions for uploading, searching, rating, and listing popular books.
All Hockey: A responsive website utilizing PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL to display popular hockey players' profiles and allow users to sign in, sign up, vote, and search for winning percentages.
I am eager to explore opportunities to apply my diverse background and skillset in an entry-level software engineering role for a growth-oriented progressive organization. Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering in Financial Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University, I hold a Bachelor of Science in Financial Mathematics from BNU-HKBU United International College and certifications in Java for Programmers and React for Front-end Developer offered by Educative.

Key skills and expertise: Java, Python, Spring Boot, Angular, Flask, MongoDB, MySQL, RESTful API, Android development, and Machine Learning.
